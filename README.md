Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that function over the internet. It involves a combination of front-end and back-end development to build user-friendly and functional online platforms. Front-end development focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a website, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create layouts, styles, and dynamic elements. Back-end development, on the other hand, manages server-side operations, databases, and application logic using languages like Python, PHP, Ruby, or Java.

Modern web development often incorporates frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Django to streamline the process and improve scalability. Web developers also use tools such as version control systems (e.g., Git) and package managers to maintain efficient workflows.

Responsive design is a key aspect, ensuring websites function seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Security measures, such as HTTPS and data encryption, are essential to protect user information and maintain trust.

With advancements in cloud computing, web applications have become more dynamic and capable, offering features like real-time updates, machine learning integration, and complex analytics. Web development continues to evolve, enabling businesses and individuals to establish a strong online presence and deliver innovative solutions to a global audience.
